# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Tensorflow
I implemented Real-Time Object Detection using Tensorflow. This is Self-learning open CV project after the object detection using Tensorflow Academic project. I used the Tensorflow model. I moved this project from bitbucket to here with latest updates. Keywords: Python(Spyder), Conda, Tensorflow, Protobuf, Numpy, Matplotlib, COCO Dataset and OpenCV.
